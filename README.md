# Object-detection-and-Speech-recognition

This is the code for a mission to detect and recognize the world around the car, and the speech recognition to talk to our client 

We used yolo and COCO to make our model

COCO, short for Common Objects in Context, is a computer vision database designed to support various research tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, image captioning, and person keypoint localization.

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm

The SSD MobileNet V2 TFLite model is commonly used for object detection tasks on edge devices.

The test.py code is for the first test for our code

The final_test.py code is for the final test mode
