# Object-detection-and-Speech-recognition

This is the code for a mission to detect and recognize the world around the car and the speech recognition to talk to the CST

We used yolo and coco to make our model

COCO, short for Common Objects in Context, is a computer vision database designed to support various research tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, image captioning, and person key points localization.

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm
